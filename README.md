# Classification Of Plants Using CNN
This project is part of the exam of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course at Politecnico
di Milano, and it corresponds to the first challenge. The aim of the project is to classify species of
plants, which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong.
Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.


The typical deep learning pipeline will be used, building a CNN from scratch and implementing
transfer learning and fine tuning with 6 CNN: ResNet152V2, InceptionV3 InceptionResNetV2, VGG16, DenseNet201, Xception, EfficientNetB0. Tensorflow and in particular
Keras framework will be used.


It is possible to check all the details of the project from the pdf in this repository, together with the notebooks of the models.
